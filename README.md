# Personal Link Sharing Site

Nothing special, just a simple Next.js 13 website to quickly point to other links on the web. Everything here should be pretty easy to customise, using standard css and standard next stuff. The only specific thing here is using the @vercel/analytics module, made to supply analytics when deployed to vercel. If you aren't going to use Vercel, feel free to remove the module and swap it out for something like Plausible. If you have any issues or need any help feel free to leave a github issue.
